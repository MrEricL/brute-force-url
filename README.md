# brute-force-url
Basic python code to iterate through a series of URLs to download PDF/image.
This is for when the url for some file has some numbers attached that may be hard to figure out.
For example:
  url.com/file1_4432432.pdf and you want to find file2 but don't know the number
  url.com/file2_<???>.pdf
  
Simply edit the run() function to include the url and iterate through the appropriate range.
